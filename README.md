## Hi there 👋

I'm Nathaniel, a Biochemistry and Physics student interested in doing side projects that teach me about science, data, and development.

I work at the intersection of biochemistry, computational biology, and the physical sciences, with an interest in advancing applications in healthcare and human space exploration.


My interests lie in two domains: The biochemical sciences and the physical sciences/engineering. My specialty is being multidisciplinary in a wide variety of technical fields ranging from computer sciences to chemistry. As a life-long learner, I'm always looking for new skills to learn and new paradigms to be aquainted with. The more knowledge and experience I can obtain means that I can draw from more sources when attempting to model reality, which allows the model to be as realistic as possible. 


My career goals include obtaining advanced degrees in Space Systems and Biochemistry. These will allow me to bridge the gap betweeen my two favorite subjects out there: Biological science and human space exploration. I aim to advance human spaceflight capabilities while simultaneously developing strategies to preseverve human health and performance in space.

But in the meantime, the projects in this portfolio represent some of my current interests and provide me with additional learning opportunies. I hope you enjoy looking through them.
